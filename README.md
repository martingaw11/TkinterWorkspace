# TkinterWorkspace

## Documenting my Tkinter Learning

## Important: Control Panel Development for Chicago Hyper Loop
## Make Shift Client Socket also made to communicate with Java Server Socket

## Notes:
 - hard to use PyQtGraph with Tkinter
  - either use matplotlib with Tkinter or switch and use Qt with PyQtGraph  

  - looks like matplotlib will have to do, will see how it handles the load of larger data sets
